Logist
------

Easy logging for humans and machines
 
```logging``` in standard library is wonderful. But if you want 
something simpler, ready-to-use and blazing fast, ```Logist``` is for you! 
Logist is a redis backed logging system with a performance of 
6000 logs/second.
 
 
## Documentation

### Installation

```bash
pip install logist
```

You need to have ```redis server``` installed and running. 
More info: [http://redis.io/](http://redis.io/) 
    
### Basic Usage

```python
from logist import Logist
logger = Logist()
logger.log(log_type, sub_type, description, log_time)
```

**log_type:** type of log - ERROR, WARNING, SUCCESS, INFO, DEBUG

**sub_type:** custom log sub types for easy tracking 
- Eg: ACCESS, WRITE, READ, EDIT, DELETE

**description:** brief log description

**log_time:** time of the logging - else auto populate


## Specific Functions

#### Success
```python
logger.success("API_LOOKUP", "20301 bytes of json data served")
```

#### Warning
```python
logger.warning("API_LOOKUP", "301 bytes of json data served")
```

#### Info
```python
logger.info("API_LOOKUP", "20301 bytes of json data served")
```

#### Error
```python
logger.error("API_LOOKUP_ERROR", "0 bytes of json data served")
```

#### Debug
```python
logger.debug("API_LOOKUP_DEBUG", "2301 bytes of csv data served")
```




## Configuration Options


REDIS_ADDRESS: Address to redis server

REDIS_PORT: redis server port

FLUSH_COUNT: log count when in-memory logs to be flushed to file

FILE_SIZE: file size when log file to be split up and compressed

LOG_FILE_NAME: name of the log file

LOG_FOLDER: folder for log files

NAMESPACE: a custom namespace for logs to be kept in redis server

COMPRESSION: a boolean field to enable/disable compression (True/False)


Either, create a configuration file with name ```logist_config.json``` 
in the pwd, like below

```json
{
    "REDIS_ADDRESS": "localhost",
    "REDIS_PORT": 6379,
    "FLUSH_COUNT": 10000,
    "FILE_SIZE": 10000000,
    "LOG_FILE_NAME": "",
    "LOG_FOLDER": "",
    "NAMESPACE": "PROJECT_NAME",
    "COMPRESSION": true
}
```

or

create Logist objects with custom configuration options required 
as shown below

```python
logger = Logist(redis_address="localhost", redis_port=6379, 
    flush_count=10000, file_size=10000000,
    log_file_name="default", log_folder="", 
    namespace="DEFAULT", compression=True)
```

## Advanced Features

#### Filter

Advanced feature to filter logs as required based on log_type, 
sub_type, description and log_location. force_refresh is used to 
reload the index from the source file/memory

```python
logger.filter(log_source="memory", date_from="", date_to="", 
    log_type="", sub_type="", description="", force_refresh=False)
```
Matches if ```description```, ```log_type``` and ```sub_type``` 
contains the particular string. ```date_from``` and ```date_to``` 
are datetime objects for filtering

#### Count

Advanced feature to filter logs as required based on log_type, 
sub_type, description and log_location. force_refresh is used to 
reload the index from the source file/memory

```python
logger.count(log_source="memory", date_from="", date_to="", log_type="", 
    sub_type="", description="", log_location="memory", force_refresh=False)
```
